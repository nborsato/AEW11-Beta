# Daniel Price
## Going for the trifecta: direct image + kinematics + chemical signature of newborn planets

I will discuss our attempts to achieve detections of newborn planets by 3 possible techniques: direct imaging, disc kinematics and chemical signatures. In particular I will discuss results of the exoALMA project to try to search for kinematic signatures of planets with the ALMA telescope, and possible hints of chemical changes induced by planets in discs and our attempts to model them.
