## Jewel Masks: Revolutionising Aperture Masking

Now over 150 years old, the technique of aperture masking interferometry has played a crucial role in high angular resolution astronomy, enabling the probing of astronomical structures beyond the classical diffraction limit. However, one major disadvantage of traditional masking methods is the penalty incurred on sensitivity, with the requirement of non-redundancy restricting the typical throughput to 10% or less. Jewel Masks are a novel optic, developed at the University of Sydney, that enables high-throughput aperture masking through the use of optically transparent wedges. We present the design and manufacturing behind Jewel Mask and finally the expected science outcomes, with the first use on the Subaru Telescope.
