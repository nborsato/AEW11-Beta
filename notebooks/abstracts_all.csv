It is a 1m space telescope at L2 entirely dedicated to the observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Ariel will observe around a thousand transiting planets, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and Earth-size planets around a range of host star types. Ariel will use transit spectroscopy in the 1.1-7.8 μm spectral range and photometry in multiple narrow bands covering the optical and near-infrared (NIR). We will focus on warm and hot planets to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials and thus reveal their bulk elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si). Observations of these warm/hot exoplanets will drive understanding of the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the nebular phase and the following few million years. Ariel will thus provide a complete picture of the chemical nature of the exoplanets. I will present the status of the development of the Ariel space mission, discuss the evolution of the science case in the context of JWST, and the very important ground based work in preparation of the Ariel input catalogue.",

Signal processing techniques, including normalization, smoothing, and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), were employed to extract orbital periods and other physical parameters. The period estimates were found to be in close alignment with those reported in the literature, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the methods employed. The quality of the normalization process was identified as a critical factor in ensuring the accuracy of period determination, as evidenced by the analysis of Kepler-84b and K00115.01. Furthermore, the study emphasises the significance of accurate time measurement in light curve analysis, through the implementation of a concise Python routine, in order to guarantee reliable outcomes.",

Among these exoplanet outliers, KELT-9b is conspicuous as the most extreme: a tidally locked, heavily irradiated, evaporating exoplanet with the highest equilibrium temperature on record (~4000 K) – and an atmosphere highly suitable for transit studies. In this study, we combined 13 transit observations from six observing sites to search for atomic and ionised species in KELT-9b's atmosphere over a wavelength range of 316–950 nm. Utilising the cross-correlation function (CCF) as a forward model, we employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling paired with bootstrapping techniques; bootstrapping, which involves repeatedly resampling data to estimate variability, allowed us to robustly fit velocity parameters for each detection. We aggregated all 13 nights of observations by constructing weights based on data quality, expected line depths, and model injection. Our comprehensive analysis resulted in the detection of 40 atomic and ionised species in KELT-9b's atmosphere. To interpret these detections, we built toy models to test the hypothesis that the species originate from different locations within the atmosphere, extending even to the planet's Roche lobe. We argue that KELT-9b's transmission spectrum exhibits properties attributable to an inflated dayside, with an extended atmosphere partially decoupled from the planet's interior atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that multiple cross-correlation detections can provide valuable insights into the atmospheric dynamics and geometrical properties of ultra-hot Jupiters.",

While the optical system and Point-Spread Function (PSF) are very stable, the infrared detectors on board suffer from a series of non-linearities – primarily charge migration or the “brighter-fatter effect” that, while challenging for other observing modes, are ruinous to the visibility calibration of the AMI mode. Local nonlinear effects produced cannot be straightforwardly corrected in the Fourier domain. Efforts using the existing pipelines have delivered some improvements, but outcomes remain far from the theoretical photon-noise limit of the instrument. This manuscript presents initial work using a fundamentally different approach: the joint implementation of a differentiable physics model of the optics, and a machine-learned Effective Detector Model (EDM), using dLux. These are trained together end-to-end, by gradient descent using the full ensemble of point-source reference targets so far observed by AMI. We infer highly- precise metrology of the AMI and NIRISS optical systems, a preliminary EDM which restores commissioning data to near-ideal precision, and illustrate initial and final residual noise floors representing the present state of this ongoing project.",

Using the photoeccentric effect, we inferred eccentricities and the underlying population distributions of sub-Saturns with periods 8-200 days with Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling. Our models include both single and mixed distributions, reflecting potentially diverse formation pathways. Our resulting distribution suggests a mixed history: approximately 85% of warm sub-Saturns are on circular orbits, suggesting in-situ or disk formation, while the remaining 15% have high eccentricities (e>0.5), requiring formation via dynamical interactions and/or high eccentricity migration. We also find a lower fraction of eccentric sub-Saturns compared to Jovians. This suggests that larger planets form, and potentially interact with comparably massive planets.",

Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent JWST/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ∼13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We present 11 years of near-IR observations of the disc in YJH, K and L'-bands. We use a combination of angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all eight epochs, consistent with the James Webb Space Telescope detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet in a 4:2:1 resonance with PDS 70 b & c. We find the spectrum is bluer compared to b and flat with respect to the star from 0.95–1.68µm. While we cannot definitively rule out a moving inner disc feature such as a spiral wake associated with b, this data lends support to the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.",

The interactions between forming planets and their surrounding discs can result in observable signatures, such as rings, gaps, and spiral structures, as well as deviations in the disc's kinematic structure. Recent advances in observation quality thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have significantly enhanced our ability to detect and characterise such features. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to constrain turbulence within these discs - a fundamental process influencing planet formation - by fitting radiative transfer models to raw visibility data from the exoALMA Large Program, with the aim of advancing our understanding of how baby planets can influence and be influenced by their birth environments.",

A previous study of gas kinematics in HD 97048 found evidence of a Jupiter-mass planet located between two dust rings. Constraining the dust grain properties in this disk therefore gives us insight into dust evolution at the time of planet formation. We observed polarized emission consistent with scattering (i.e., the scattering of thermal emission from dust grains by other dust grains) in the disk. The polarization fraction and angle are correlated with the disk's ring and gap substructure. The polarization fraction is higher in the gap and inner cavity than in the first ring, and the polarization angles are more azimuthally oriented in the gap while the polarization angle in the first ring is more parallel to the disk's minor axis. These changes in polarization fraction and angle are expected to arise from variations in optical depth and the direction of the radiation anisotropy within the disk. We model the expected polarization in this disk for dust grain populations with varying sizes and porosities, and discuss the implications for dust evolution this planet-forming disk.",

Ongoing studies of the planetary systems discovered by those spacecraft have reveal that many host multiple planets - and there is a growing consensus that that trend will only become more pronounced as observatory facilities on Earth continue to push the search for alien worlds to ever smaller planets. A common theme among transiting exoplanet systems that host multiple planets is that those systems tend to be 'dynamically packed' - in other words, that the planets therein are so close to one another that there is no room for additional planets to exist on stable orbits between them. In this work, we examine seven planetary systems discovered by TESS that each contain two confirmed exoplanets. We ask the question 'Are these systems dynamically packed, or is there room for additional planets between those that have already been identified.'. To answer this question, we present the results of detailed and extensive suites of high-resolution n-body dynamical simulations that investigate the stability of hypothetical Earth-mass planets in these systems. Our results will help to direct the future search for additional planets around these stars, identifying those systems that are ideal targets for future follow-up work.",

Exoplanetary science lies at the threshold of characterizing hundreds of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, thereby providing a statistical sample far greater than the limited inventory of terrestrial planetary atmospheres within the Solar System. However, the model-based approach for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres relies on Solar System data, resulting in our limited inventory being both foundational and critical atmospheric laboratories. Present terrestrial exoplanet demographics are heavily biased toward short-period planets, many of which are expected to be tidally locked, and also potentially runaway greenhouse candidates, similar to Venus. Here we describe the rise in the terrestrial exoplanet population and the study of tidal locking on climate simulations. These exoplanet studies are placed within the context of Venus, a local example of an Earth-sized, asynchronous rotator that is near the tidal locking limit. We describe the recent lessons learned regarding the dynamics of the Venusian atmosphere and how those lessons pertain to the evolution of our sibling planet. We discuss the implications of these lessons for exoplanet atmospheres and their detection with observations using JWST and other future facilities. We outline the crucial data that will be acquired from the coming Venus missions (DAVINCI, EnVision, VERITAS), and the need for further characterization of the Venusian climate in order to achieve a full and robust interpretation of terrestrial planetary atmospheres.",

Thus far, TESS has successfully identified approximately 400 transiting exoplanets, in addition to roughly 6 000 candidate exoplanets pending confirmation. In this study, we present the results of our ongoing project, the Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST). Our dedicated effort is focused on the confirmation and characterisation of new exoplanets through the application of statistical validation tools. Through a combination of ground-based telescope data, high-resolution imaging, and the utilisation of the statistical validation tool known as TRICERATOPS, we have successfully discovered eight potential super-Earths. These planets bear the designations: TOI-238b (1.61 +0.09−0.10 R ⊕ ), TOI-771b (1.42 +0.11−0.09 R ⊕ ), TOI-871b (1.66 +0.11−0.11 R ⊕ ), TOI-1467b (1.83 +0.16−0.15 R ⊕ ), TOI-1739b (1.69 +0.10−0.08 R ⊕ ), TOI-2068b (1.82 +0.16−0.15 R ⊕ ), TOI-4559b (1.42 +0.13−0.11 R ⊕ ), and TOI-5799b (1.62 +0.19−0.13 R ⊕ ). Among all these planets, six of them fall within the region known as ‘keystone planets’, which makes them particularly interesting for study. Based on the location of TOI-771b and TOI-4559b below the radius valley we characterised them as likely super-Earths, though radial velocity mass measurements for these planets will provide more details about their characterisation. It is noteworthy that planets within the size range investigated herein are absent from our own solar system, making their study crucial for gaining insights into the evolutionary stages between Earth and Neptune.",

Of the 22 systems hosting at least one giant planet, we report candidate TTV signals in 9 of them. The first of its kind, this catalog will improve upon the work of Kepler TTV catalogs, as TESS host stars are generally brighter than Kepler hosts. This increases the follow-up potential of these systems with other observation methods and enables confirmation of more tentative signals with ground-based observatories.

It has become a powerful tool in the search for exoplanets, along with contributing to studies of stellar evolution through asteroseismology. By targeting bright stars amenable to radial velocity follow-up, the TESS mission aims to increase our statistical sample of exoplanets with accurate radius and mass measurements. It will also provide excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy. This will help to address outstanding issues in planet formation and evolution, such as testing classic core accretion and migration scenarios. TESS has already discovered thousands of exoplanet candidates across both celestial hemispheres, making these known to the public in the form of TESS Objects of Interest (TOI). However, we often need photometric and spectroscopic follow-up, combined with statistical tests, to validate a candidate as a true exoplanet rather than a false positive (such as an eclipsing binary). Whilst many facilities exist to perform follow-up measurements for stars visible from the Northern hemisphere, the same cannot be said about the Southern hemisphere. Tasmania is a unique location to perform follow-up, due to our mid Southern latitude and existing telescopic infrastructure. Over the Summer of 2023 to 2024, 5 TOIs classified as planetary candidates were observed with the new UTAS Harlingten 50cm telescope.

One of the limiting factors of microlensing planet searches is to obtain accurate mass measurements. An approach to break this limit is to use constraints from high angular resolution follow-up observations (with KECK and HST until now) to measure the source-lens relative proper motions and flux ratios. I will present results from follow-up AO observations of microlensing events, discussing various types of planetary systems, located in different corners of our galaxy.

However, separating the faint planetary light from its host star is extremely challenging, requiring high contrasts and tight angular separations. Nulling Interferometry offers a solution by destructively interfering light from an on-axis host star, while constructively interfering light from its companion, effectively ‘nulling out’ the starlight. The Guided Light Interferometric Nulling Technology (GLINT) instrument, downstream of the SCExAO system on the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope (Hawai’i, USA), performs nulling interferometry in the H-band. GLINT uses photonic technology with laser-inscribed waveguides to couple light within a glass chip and has previously resolved angular separations 2.5 times smaller than the telescope’s diffraction limit. Recently, GLINT underwent a major upgrade in its optical design and installation of a new chip to enhance sensitivity. This upgraded version of GLINT will be tested on-sky mid-September 2024, aiming to demonstrate its scalable capabilities for future use on larger-class telescopes and long-baseline interferometers.

Still, simultaneously replicating the four terrestrial planets’ orbits/masses and the asteroid belt’s main properties remain elusive. Here, we investigated the simultaneous formation of the four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the asteroid belt in the context of the JSCE scenario. We found that our terrestrial systems satisfied several inner solar system constraints. An analysis of 37 optimally formed terrestrial planet systems allowed us to constrain the planets’ building blocks, accretion history, and other fundamental properties. First, the obtained terrestrial planets acquired orbits and masses very similar to those observed in our solar system. In addition, other key results include Moon-forming giant impacts occurring within ~60 Myr, terrestrial planets’ bombardment of late impactors represented by disk objects formed within 2 au, and bulk water acquired during the first 10–20 Myr of Earth’s formation. In particular, achieving Earth’s estimated bulk water content required the disk to initially contain sufficient water mass in objects beyond ~1–1.5 au. This requirement implies that Mercury, Venus, and Mars acquired water similar to the amount on Earth during their formation. Finally, our model asteroid belt explained the asteroid belt’s orbital structure, small mass, and taxonomy (S-, C- and D/P-types). The current asteroids represent a mixture of local asteroids that survived the dynamical depletion of the primordial asteroid belt by JSCE and captured asteroids from trans-Jovian reservoirs during the giant-planet instability/migration.",

However, most (> 80%) confirmed transiting exoplanets will not be accessible to JWST during the mission’s lifetime. This widespread problem is due mostly to ephemeris degradation: uncertainties on transit time and period compound over time, which can culminate in predicted future transits being off by hours to days when targeting planets years later. With this in mind, I am leading the K2 & TESS Synergy, a large-scale effort to reanalyze all ~300 systems originally discovered by NASA’s K2 mission with new observations from TESS. We are combining light curves from both missions along with archival radial velocities, Gaia parallaxes, and spectral energy distributions in global fits which will not only allow us to update the ephemerides, but also build a self-consistent homogeneous catalog of system parameters for future population studies. We have now made ~75 K2 planetary systems accessible to JWST (including the top 50 transmission spectroscopy targets) through the inclusion of new TESS observations, and identified multiple systems with incorrect transit ephemerides due to systematics in the discovery observations. I will discuss the impact of these results for future characterization efforts, our recent effort to recover the lost ephemeris of K2’s first exoplanet discovery, and our plans to have the full K2 catalog reanalysis completed within the next two years.

We will present the results of extensive polarization observations of this star over 5 years, and show how these observations can provide information on the mass ejection process and the evolution of the disk through the outburst cycle.","Observations of the polarization of extrasolar planets are a potential method of atmopheric characterization and searching for habitability and life. We have recently been using our PICSARR polarimeters to take new sets of polarization observations of a wide range of solar system objects (planets, satellites and asteroids) with higher precision than most previous studies. Here we will present results that compare the polarization properties of rocky and icy surfaces and planets with extensive atmospheres and comment on the applicability of such methods to exoplanets.",

We study the complex dynamics of stellar triples and their coupling to stellar evolution. We examine how the orbital evolution affects the inner binary's stellar evolution and interaction and estimate the rates for stellar mergers, collisions and observable transients. For massive compact stellar triples, we find that a significant fraction could merge either on the main sequence or after the inner binary has collapsed into binary black-holes, generating a gravitational-wave merger event. For low and intermediate-mass stars, we find that wide stellar triples could be perturbed by the galactic tide and acquire extremely highly-eccentric orbits. In turn, stellar inspirals and collisions could dominate the collisional field population in generating field blue stragglers, proto-cataclysmic variables and double red-giant collisions and contribute to double white-dwarf collisions and type Ia Supernova progenitors.","Hot Jupiters (HJ) are gas giant planets with approximately Jovian masses orbiting their host star with short orbital periods of just a few days. Their ubiquity challenges the current formation channels. HJ most likely formed elsewhere and migrated either in a disc or via high-eccentricity migration and tidal circularisation. Moreover, the significant obliquity angle (the angle between the stellar spin and planetary orbit) suggests that high-eccentricity migration is prevalent. We show that the eccentricity of the proto-HJ can be efficiently pumped by the Lidov-Kozai (LK) mechanism in the presence of an outer binary star. When the stellar binary is ultra-wide, it can be perturbed by the Galactic tidal field. We show that this 'wide-binary' channel is more efficient than the standard LK mechanism due to the chaotic dynamics experienced at a wide range of mutual inclinations.

The Sun is so far the only isolated main sequence star detected in gamma-rays, and is particularly bright during powerful flares. Young dwarf stars of K-type and later are far more magnetically active than the Sun, which makes them excellent candidates for gamma-ray searches. With over 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, we analysed the phase-folded light curve of the fast-rotating radio M9 star TVLM 513-46546 and reported a tentative detection of a gamma-ray pulse associated with its rotation. This is the first detection of an isolated main-sequence star in gamma-rays. We also stack Fermi-LAT data during flare events identified from radio, optical and X-ray flare surveys for K-type and later dwarf stars. This stacking survey indicates an upper limit of gamma-ray emission from the population of flare stars. The stellar gamma-ray emission likely originates from the decay of neutral pions generated by relativistic protons interacting within the stellar atmosphere. These gamma-ray observations can be used to constrain the particle acceleration mechanisms and the resulting stellar energetic particle spectrum. Extrapolating the GeV emission enables the estimation of TeV detectability with the Cherenkov Telescope Array. The estimated magnitude of these flares and the associated stellar winds and coronal mass ejections can be compared to the Solar flares that cause extreme geomagnetic events on Earth. Frequent, repeated events would then likely evaporate parts or all of the exoplanet atmosphere hence decreasing its long-term habitability. This impact is being examined through detailed photochemical evolution models of exoplanet atmosphere PHOTOCHEM.","Many occurrences in the early stages of planet formation can impact the fate of the system.

However, if a star is orbited by an unseen companion, the track is slightly distorted leading to a potentially inaccurate calculation of the system’s proper motion and parallax. This discrepancy is quantified by the renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) reported in the Gaia catalogue. The higher the RUWE, the greater the discrepancy. Using Bayesian inference with pystan, we use this error and the fitted track parameters to constrain the nature of a potential binary system using data from Gaia’s DR3. From this, it is possible to calculate the true parallax and proper motion of the system. I apply this method to several examples ranging from brown dwarf companions to main sequence binaries to black holes. Finally, I demonstrate the extra potential this method has when epoch data is released in DR4.","Astrometry with Gaia holds a unique place among planet detection methods, being most sensitive to periods comparable to gas giants in our solar system.

Spectral synthesis of the lithium line at ~670.78 nm yielded a lithium abundance A(Li)~0.4 dex. This value is unusually low for solar twins of similar age, which typically have A(Li) values ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 dex, suggesting that ~2 dex of lithium is missing.

I will present an in-depth study and comparison of two metal-poor, distant stellar streams originally identified in the Dark Energy Survey: Elqui and Turranburra – the latter named after Sydney’s Lane Cove River. Both dwarf galaxy streams are rather distant, with Elqui at a Galactocentric distance of 52 kpc and Turranburra at 28 kpc. In previous work, both streams have been found to have high velocity dispersions and low mean metallicities, implying that their progenitors were relatively low-mass dwarf galaxies.Through studying the dynamics and properties of these two streams, we are increasing our understanding of the accretion history of the Milky Way, as well shedding light on the broader processes that shape galaxy formation in general.",,

We monitored the evolution of surface activity and the large-scale magnetic field between 2004 and 2019 using Doppler Imaging (DI), Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and chromospheric CaII H&K emissions. The large-scale magnetic field appears to undergo 3-4 yr fluctuations, evolving from weak and simple during activity minima to strong and complex during activity maxima, but without the global magnetic polarity reversals observed for more mature stars. Additionally, we assessed the effectiveness of DI in modelling radial velocity variations induced by magnetic activity, and established realistic detection limits for exoplanets in the presence of the extreme stellar activity of young Suns.",,

Yet, as our datasets grow exponentially, our current focus has shifted towards quantity and coverage, sometimes at the expense of quality. Our models also often struggle to fully capture the complexities of stellar atmospheres and line formation, particularly as stars evolve. This limits our ability to better understand the intricate details of stellar evolution. These challenges are magnified when transitioning from resolved stellar spectroscopy to unresolved systems, where less advanced tools constrain our interpretations of extragalactic observations. In this talk, I will explore the cutting-edge developments in stellar spectroscopy, emphasizing the critical gaps in our models and how they hinder our understanding of stellar and galactic evolution. I will also highlight the potential of ongoing missions like Gaia, GALAH, SDSS-V, and the extragalactic GECKOS project, alongside upcoming facilities such as 4MOST. These instruments promise to revolutionize our ability to probe stellar populations, but achieving the next breakthrough will require a shift toward higher-quality, more precise observations.

This talk presents research on high-mass red giants, specifically secondary clump stars. Many of these stars show suppressed dipole modes, potentially indicating strong internal magnetic fields. However, spectroscopy reveals no correlation between surface chromospheric activity (S-index) and dipole mode suppression. Instead, a stronger S-index is linked to weaker radial modes, which are localised to the star's surface. This is the first direct evidence that chromospheric activity can suppress overall oscillation strength, and also may suggest that internal and surface magnetic fields in red giants are not necessarily correlated. We also explore the possibility of binary interactions but find no strong candidates. Additionally, we identify a secondary clump star kinematically consistent with the Galactic Halo despite its young age and high metallicity, possibly ejected from a triple system early in its life.

To be properly studied, the emission from planetary nebulae must be described, accounting for interstellar extinction. Unfortunately, conventional methods of estimating extinction to PNe are not in good agreement. The advent of Gaia has made possible the systematic identification of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN). We suggest using these CSPN to gauge the interstellar extinction to their associated PNe. We have used the PySSED program to collate photometry measurements from available stellar sky surveys, producing SEDs of the CSPN. We demonstrate that the intrinsic shape of CSPN spectra has a weak dependence on temperature and composition, so any deviation from the standard spectral shape can be attributed to interstellar dust extinction. We can therefore use our SEDs to fit extinction values to planetary nebulae. We find that our results are in good agreement with those from dust maps, with greater resolution and more sensitivity to higher extinction values.",,

Observations of molecular lines allow us to study the circumstellar material around AGB stars, from which we can derive mass-loss rates and study the chemistry of dust formation. Previous studies of the molecules in AGB stellar winds found that several molecules have strong dependences on the mass-loss rate or the density of the wind, showing either different abundances or distributions with wind density. Other molecules are only present if there is a stellar companion affecting the wind chemistry with its UV light. To explore these phenomenon further, we examined the molecular emission around two of the highest mass-loss rate AGB stars that have been observed with ALMA. Both stars are also known to have intermediate initial masses (~4 to 8 solar masses). In addition to several expected molecules, we found a large number of emission lines coming from the salt molecules NaCl and KCl.

Such characteristics make them ideal celestial laboratories to investigate magnetospheric physics. The magnetospheres of these stars emit over a wide range of frequencies including radio. The radio emission is non-thermal in nature and can be incoherent or coherent. While a lot of efforts have gone into characterizing these emission, especially in the optical band, characterization of their radio emission is yet to be accomplished. This is a critical limitation since radio is the primary magnetospheric signatures for magnetic late B and A type stars. Radio is also the band at which a number of similarities are observed between hot stars and cool stars/brown dwarfs with large-scale magnetic fields. The primary obstacle in characterzing radio emission is the small size of the sample of known radio-bright magnetic hot stars. In my talk, I will present the 'VAST project to study Magnetic Massive Stars' (VAST-MeMeS) that aims to take advantage of the enormous amount of radio data that the ASKAP telescope is collecting, in order to overcome this problem and answer key questions such as the driver of non-thermal emission.

The largest surveys range from several million stars (e.g., LAMOST) to the roughly quarter-billion stars observed with Gaia XP spectra. These survey data are generally at low or moderate spectroscopic resolutions, yet the “gold standard” for determining stellar parameters and elemental abundances remains high-resolution spectroscopic data. We have used The Cannon, a largely Australian-developed, data-driven method to transfer labels from high-resolution reference data to lower-resolution data, specifically applying stellar parameters and abundances derived from GALAH data (GALAH iDR4) to Gaia RVS spectra (Gaia DR3). We trained our data model on ~14000 selected targets common to both surveys, utilising the stellar labels from GALAH. With this model, we are able to consistently predict stellar parameters such as Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and abundances of several alpha elements for over 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra. Using stars from several open and globular clusters present in the Gaia RVS catalogue, we have validated our metallicity estimates. Finally, for a subset of this sample with predicted log g < 3.5 (i.e., giants) we are able to measure the abundances of several neutron-capture elements, illustrating the exciting potential of this method for reliably determining stellar parameters and abundances from medium-resolution Gaia RVS spectra – a dataset which, by the end of the Gaia mission, is expected to include over 30 million stars.",,

A part of understanding stellar space weather requires dedicated monitoring of individual stars across a variety of wavelengths to guarantee observing both a flare and the related particle acceleration. However, coordinating long-term, simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations is notoriously difficult.

We propose that this trend reflects young stellar populations transitioning from the fractal state characteristic of newly formed stellar ensembles to the dynamically relaxed state that characterises older bound stellar populations, including open and globular clusters. We find that our hierarchical cluster sample transitions to a dynamically relaxed state at a characteristic size scale of approximately 0.80 pc and a characteristic free-fall time of ≤ 2 Myr. In addition, we explore the clustering properties and stellar luminosity functions of the young, main-sequence stellar populations.

However, recent work has demonstrated fundamental limitations in light curve inversion methods, including the ability to model any light curve with a two-spot model and the retrieval of, at best, only 50% of the surface information—often much less. This work demonstrates that high-precision astrometry offers a superior alternative for stellar surface mapping of nearby stars. Our approach not only yields more comprehensive information about stellar surfaces but also achieves finer “resolution” compared to traditional methods.

However, stellar ages cannot be directly measured and must instead be estimated or inferred. Asteroseismology—the study of stellar pulsations—is one of the most promising methods for inferring stellar ages, but its accuracy depends heavily on the theoretical stellar models used, which suffer from poorly characterised uncertainties. We have quantified systematic age uncertainties for 1.5-2.5 Msun delta Scuti stars. To support this, we present a comprehensive grid of 60 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the MESA and GYRE codes. In contrast to previous work, such as [Murphy et al.

This happens before the system goes into common envelope (CE) phase. We need to understand the formation, evolution and longevity of the disk and what the impact of the disk (and possible jets) is on the CE phase that follows. So far analytical studies of the mass transfer phase, and a handful of hydrodynamic simulations (including global CE simulations) attempt to answer these questions but with very poor results. I present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of an accretion disk around a 1.4 Mo, NS in an intermediate mass X-ray binary with a 7 Mo red supergiant using a grid and an SPH code.

However the luminosity of an AGB star does not provide a unique initial (or current) stellar mass, owing to the core-mass luminosity relationship which is degenerate for stars less than 2 solar masses. In this talk I summarise our efforts to derive the initial masses of S-type AGB stars from their stellar pulsations. Surveys of post-AGB stars in the LMC and SMC have also discovered objects with surface compositions showing large enrichments in carbon and elements heavier than iron.

Even if we don't completely understand globular cluster abundance anomalies, we can make use of them.

Post-AGB stars are often found dancing in orbit with a main sequence companion and are further observed to be surrounded by a dusty circumbinary disk. These objects have recently left the turbulent AGB phase after experiencing significant, rapid mass-loss driven by binary interaction. The exact evolutionary pathway and mechanisms responsible for producing the observational properties of these systems remains unclear, and clearly deviates from classical binary evolution scenarios. In this study, we use the open-source 1D stellar evolution code MESA to simulate the accretion of metal-poor gas from a circumbinary disk onto an evolving post-AGB star, to examine the formation of chemical depletion patterns in post-AGB star photospheres. Further, we explore the impact of accretion on the structural evolution of post-AGB stars, as well as the timescale of post-AGB evolution, which may have important consequences on the formation of complex planetary nebulae.",,

Within this framework, post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars (of A, F, G, and K spectral types) with circumbinary discs exhibit intriguing photospheric chemical depletion, notably marked by a depletion of refractory elements (e.g., Al, Fe, Ti, s-process elements) relative to volatile elements (e.g., S, Zn, Na, K). The underlying mechanism driving this depletion remains not yet fully understood, but it likely stems from the chemical fractionation of gas and dust within the circumbinary disc, followed by the re-accretion of pristine gas onto the primary star. Recent observational studies have shown that these circumbinary discs are similar to the protoplanetary discs (PPDs) around young stars in terms of infrared excess, keplerian rotation, and dust mineralogy. Notably, a subset of post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars hosts “transition” discs characterised by large inner cavities similar to those observed in PPDs, suggesting the potential presence of a giant planet carving a hole in the disc. To further investigate the chemical depletion process in these targets, we conducted a detailed chemical abundance analysis of all known transition disc systems, totaling 12 in both the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud (characterised by moderate-to-high mid-infrared excess and substantial depletion efficiency [S/Ti] > 1.3 dex). We used high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT to study how chemical depletion correlates with various parameters from both the host star (e.g., photometric, orbital, pulsational) and the disc (orientation, size, morphology). We confirmed that depletion efficiency in transition disc systems is higher than in other evolved binary stars. Additionally, we found that the derived chemical depletion patterns in our evolved binary systems are matching those observed in young planet-hosting stars and are mostly in line with those observed in interstellar medium. We also found that the pulsation period of our targets is strongly anti-correlated with the infrared luminosity produced by the circumbinary disc.

This typically takes place when one of the two stars expands on its journey to becoming a giant. Typically the more compact of the two stars experience a (gravitational) drag force at the hand of the envelope of the larger star, which leads to either the complete ejection of the common envelope, or to the companion merging with the primary. CEs are thought to be the main mechanism to form compact evolved binaries such as the neutron star binaries, NS-black-hole or binary black holes that can merge and generate observable gravitational waves. It is entirely plausible that the transients named luminous red novae are common envelope interactions caught in the act. 3D simulations are required to quantify the CE physical mechanism, due to the complex asymmetric nature of CE evolution. To constrain the simulations and make them effective tools to explain observations, we need to predict light curves.

On the other hand, a class of post-red and asymptotic giant branch systems (post-RGB and post-AGB) appear to have wider separations, but also small enough that a common envelope interaction must have taken place. These systems always have a large, low mass circumbinary disk. I present scenarios to form large, circumbinary disks that form either as fallback of material that remains bound to the binary after the a CE interaction, or that are created by a weaker, ‘glancing’, interaction. My research explores the regime that must exist between a classical common envelope with its extreme in-spiral and a `glancing' common envelope with a reduced in-spiral, by using 3D hydrodynamic simulations of both discs and the common envelope phase itself, as a two-pronged approach, to probe this intermediate regime and explain post-RGB and AGB binaries and related objects such as barium stars, CEMP stars and other post-interaction objects.",,

Such mixing can renew the hydrogen fuel in the stellar cores, thereby significantly extending their main-sequence lifetimes and increasing the final helium core mass obtained at core hydrogen exhaustion. Different mixing processes occurring near the convective boundaries are collectively referred to as convective boundary mixing (CBM). Their implementation in 1D stellar structure and evolution codes generally rely on at least one free parameter that defines the extent and mixing efficiency in this region. One such type of CBM is convective penetration. Recently, 3D numerical simulations of convective penetration occurring at the boundary of convective cores suggest that the extent of this CBM region can be directly computed from the properties of the core and changes size as the star evolves. Here we investigate if gravity mode oscillations, which have the highest probing power near the convective core, are sensitive to such time dependent CBM and if such mixing is sufficient to explain the gravity mode oscillations observed in Slowly Pulsating B stars.",,
n.rsegovia@unsw.edu.au,Nicolas,Rodriguez-Segovia,UNSW Canberra,Student,Man,Stars in Brisbane ONLY,Sub-dwarf B stars with COMPAS and MESA,,Talk,"Yes, I have already registered",Yes,N/A,"Sub-dwarf B (sdB) stars are low-mass stars that have a thin outer hydrogen layer and helium-burning interior, usually corresponding to the exposed cores of stars near the tip of the red giant branch. However, the process through which they lose most of their hydrogen rich envelope is not completely clear. Amongst possible formation scenarios, binary evolution is the most accepted, encompassing both stable and unstable mass transfer as well as mergers. To have a better understanding of the characteristics of these different formation channels and the current-day sdB population, we use the rapid binary population synthesis (BPS) code COMPAS (Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics and Statistics) to investigate production pathways of these low-mass stars for the first time. We also adapt results from detailed modelling of sdBs with MESA from the literature, apply them to our population synthesis results and further improve the estimates about the physical properties of our population. We discuss our results by comparing them against previous studies available in the literature, highlight agreement with observables and propose potential applications.",,

I will use my previous experience with machine learning and spectra to identify previously unknown lithium-rich giants. I will develop a comprehensive population synthesis model for RGB and red clump stars that will make it possible to test whether the various mechanisms proposed in the literature are actually responsible for the high lithium abundances in these stars.",,
d.stello@unsw.edu.au,Dennis,Stello,UNSW,Faculty/Staff (continuing position),Man,Stars in Brisbane ONLY,The Kepler Ultra Deep Field,,Talk,"Signed up for Stars+Exo, but would have to leave Wed eve, so cant attend the dinner either.",No,N/A,"Over the past decade, the Kepler mission has been revolutionising our knowledge about stars in the Galactic disk. This is because Kepler’s photometric data of unprecedented quality, can reveal tiny variations in stellar brightness caused by standing sound wave oscillations inside stars. Every half hour over 4 years, Kepler recorded images of its fixed field of view, which were downlinked to Earth. Photometric data from the images was initially produced only for the 200,000 mission targets, mostly bright near-by disk stars. This left all non-targeted stars in the images unutilized. Crucially though, NASA created in late 2023 the photometric data for all 400,000 non-target stars that were serendipitously observed; with the same quality as the original targets. These new ‘Kepler-Bonus’ data are dominated by much fainter – hence more distant – stars. In this presentation I will show that the data will give us detections to measure oscillations in red giant stars out to hundreds of kilo parsec – essentially to the ‘edge’ of the Galaxy – making this the only data in the foreseeable future to investigate the most pristine part of the Galaxy with such high fidelity.",,
mark.walker@manlyastrophysics.org,Mark,Walker,Manly Astrophysics,Faculty/Staff (continuing position),Man,Stars in Brisbane ONLY,"Winds, disruptions and accretion in R Coronae Borealis",,Talk,"Yes, I have already registered",No,N/A,"Luminous stars can drive fast dust-winds from the surfaces of hydrogen snow clouds, leading to deep eclipses lasting for several months when a cloud's orbit takes it within a few AU of the star. Such close interactions involve tidal disruption of the cloud, with the star accreting helium as a result. This scenario provides a simple account of the dimming events of R Coronae Borealis stars, and simultaneously explains why these events occur specifically in hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants: as fast as it accretes, the helium is burnt on the surface of a degenerate core. By way of contrast we will show eclipse light-curves for systems where the luminosity is moderate or low, as would be expected for a non-degenerate disruptor/accretor. We also identify the source of the observed chromospheric emission lines and near-/mid-IR excess flux, in the context of this disruption/accretion model of RCBs.",,

We explore the clustering properties and stellar luminosity functions of the young, main-sequence stellar populations. Our analysis allows us to conclude that the observed hierarchy is driven by supersonic turbulence, as evidenced by the fitted fractal dimensions via $\chi^2$ optimisation of the clustering size distributions. With respect to previous studies, we identify a smaller extent of star-forming hierarchy in Messier 17, distinguishing it from older, more developed regions like the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds on galaxy-wide scales.",,
ryan.white@uq.edu.au,Ryan,White,University of Queensland,Student,Man,Stars in Brisbane ONLY,JWST Imaging of Colliding Wind Nebulae and the GRB Progenitor Apep,,Talk,"Yes, I have already registered",Yes,N/A,"Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the powerful and beautiful end-of-life stages of the most massive stars. In their final throes, they enrich the interstellar medium with carbon and heavy elements before finally undergoing core-collapse supernova. Most massive stars evolve in pairs, and so handful of these WR stars interact with another massive stellar companion and produce quickly evolving spiral dust nebulae in what is called a colliding wind binary. I spend my time developing and fitting fast geometric models to these nebulae, which uniquely reveal the sensitive orbital and stellar physics happening beyond our view. With new JWST images being revealed of these systems, we can use our models on these unique stellar laboratories to probe the physics of massive binary evolution in a phase right before supernova, and potentially shed light on the roles of WR+O/WR systems as gamma-ray burst progenitors.",,
daniel.zucker@mq.edu.au,Daniel,Zucker,Macquarie University,Faculty/Staff (continuing position),Man,Stars in Brisbane ONLY,Crossing the Streams: The S5 Survey’s View of the Galactic Halo,,Talk,"Yes, I have already registered",No,N/A,"Large galaxies like the Milky Way form hierarchically, with smaller systems merging and accreting to form increasingly massive structures. Evidence for this process can be found all around us: dynamically, as stellar overdensities in phase space in the nearby Galaxy; chemically, in the form of abundance patterns distinct from those of stars which formed in situ within the Milky Way; and spatially, in the form of stellar streams and tidally disrupting satellites in the Galactic halo. This last domain – a halo dramatically criss-crossed by an abundance of stellar substructures – is the focus of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5), an Australian-led international collaboration using the AAT + AAOmega to study the streams and disrupting satellites surrounding the Milky Way. Its science goals include characterising the Galaxy’s accretion history and constraining the distribution of matter interior to stream orbits. Among the science results I will discuss are evidence for the influence of the LMC on halo stream orbits (and the Milky Way itself), the orbital properties of the stellar streams observed, and comparisons with simulation predictions for detectable streams and satellites. I will conclude with a look at the prospects of new facilities such as LSST and 4MOST for driving major advances in our understanding of how galaxies like the Milky Way grow.",,
