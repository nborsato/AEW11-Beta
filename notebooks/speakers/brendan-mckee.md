# Brendan McKee
## Searching for Companions to Hot Jupiters

Hot Jupiters are giant planets that orbit close to their host stars. Transit timing variations (TTVs) are deviations away from a constant orbital period. These may be due to interactions of the planet with the star, or with another planet in the system. Companions to hot Jupiters are rare, and searching for these TTVs may reveal otherwise hidden planets. The rate at which companions form will reveal the formation history of hot Jupiters.
