# Christophe Pinte
## First results from the exoALMA planet hunting campaign

Exoplanetary systems show an incredible diversity, hosting planets with a vast range of masses, radii, and orbital separations. However, it is unclear whether this diversity stems from a distribution of initial conditions, and/or the result of multiple planet formation pathways. It is therefore fundamental to detect young, embedded planets during the process of formation. While the planets likely remain hidden by the disk at near-infrared wavelengths, they leave clear signatures in the velocity field in their vicinity, which can be detected with line observations with ALMA. This led to the developement of the "disk kinematic" planet detection method in the last 5 years, and offers a unique opportunity to probe the distribution of planets at the extreme earliest stages of their formation. In this contribution, we present the results of the exoALMA planet-hunting campaign that targeted 15 protoplanetary disks with deep, high spatial, and high spectral resolution observations line observations. We will discuss our planet detection statistics, the constraints we can place on these youngest planets, and their implication for the planet formation pathways, as well as our new kinematic view of the physical processes at play during planet formation.
