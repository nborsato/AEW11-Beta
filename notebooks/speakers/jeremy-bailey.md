## Polarization of the Solar System observed with PICSARR

Observations of the polarization of extrasolar planets are a potential method of atmopheric characterization and searching for habitability and life. We have recently been using our PICSARR polarimeters to take new sets of polarization observations of a wide range of solar system objects (planets, satellites and asteroids) with higher precision than most previous studies. Here we will present results that compare the polarization properties of rocky and icy surfaces and planets with extensive atmospheres and comment on the applicability of such methods to exoplanets.
