## Constraining Turbulence in Protoplanetary Discs

High-resolution observations of protoplanetary discs offer a unique window into the early stages of planetary system formation. The interactions between forming planets and their surrounding discs can result in observable signatures, such as rings, gaps, and spiral structures, as well as deviations in the disc's kinematic structure. Recent advances in observation quality thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have significantly enhanced our ability to detect and characterise such features. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to constrain turbulence within these discs - a fundamental process influencing planet formation - by fitting radiative transfer models to raw visibility data from the exoALMA Large Program, with the aim of advancing our understanding of how baby planets can influence and be influenced by their birth environments.
